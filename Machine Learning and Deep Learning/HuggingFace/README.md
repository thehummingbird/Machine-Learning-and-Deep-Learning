# Hugging Face ðŸ¤— Experiments from Scratch

This repository is meant for Deep Learning experiments using HuggingFace ðŸ¤— library, which makes researching and deploying NLP and Vision DL models insanely easy and time/cost/energy efficient. 

**Problem with Deep Learnings**

Researching and deploying a Deep Learning Model is a time, money and energy consuming task. While there have been amazing leaps in what deep learning models can do, it takes a lot of compute, data and DL specific engineering expertise to train, test and deploy models. And let's not even get into how much energy it takes to train a giant model with millions of parameters. These are big problems, aren't they?

**Enter Hugging Face**

**What is HuggingFace?**
Huggingface, apart from the emoji ðŸ¤—, is an AI company and community. It provides a Deep Learning Library by the same name to - 
* use, test and deploy pre-trained models
* fine-tune pre-trained models for use and deployment
* share your trained models

**But all with minimum lines of code on Python, using numerous APIs to simplify the process of researching and deploying NLP and Vision models in both academia and industry.**

Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of engineering in the Deep Learning world - 
* DL Research and Development to make and enable better models, 
* DL deployment for building products

I strongly believe that with the current rate of Hugging Face's developments, they would become increasinly effecting in providing DL infrastructure for the second kind.

And this repository will always be a work in progress, as I go deeper in their APIs for the second kind of engineering, which is what I love ;)

**JARGON ALERT!!**
Hugging Face is most known for their Transformer models for NLP tasks (and Vision, which is a new development).
For the unintiated, Transformers were introduced in 2017 by Vaswani et all in the paper titled "Attention is All You Need" (A quick google search would do a better job in explaining this)

Since then, Transformers have taken the world of NLP and Vision by storm. And Hugging Face currently provides an amazing infrastructure to play with them for NLP and Vision tasks with minimal DL specific engineering.

You would find a list of notebooks in this repository (always a work in progress) explaining almost everything about Hugging Face APIs for these tasks from scratch

I hope you find them useful. Feedback always appreciated :)

Cheers!
