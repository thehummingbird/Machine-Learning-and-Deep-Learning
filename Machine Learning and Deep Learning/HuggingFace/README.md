# Hugging Face ðŸ¤— Experiments from Scratch

This repository is meant for Deep Learning experiments using HuggingFace ðŸ¤— library, which makes researching and deploying NLP and Vision DL models insanely easy and time/cost/energy efficient. 

**Problem with Deep Learnings**

Researching and deploying a Deep Learning Model is a time, money and energy consuming task. While there have been amazing leaps in what deep learning models do, it takes a lot of compute, data and DL specific engineering expertise to train, test and deploy models. And let's not even get into how much energy it takes to train a giant model with millions of parameters. These are big problems, isn't it?

**Enter Hugging Face**

**What is HuggingFace?**
Huggingface, apart from the emoji ðŸ¤—, an AI company and community. It provides a Deep Learning Library by the same name to - 
* use pre-trained models
* fine-tune pre-trained models
* share your trained models

**But all with minimum lines of code on Python, using numerous APIs to simplify the process of researching and deploying NLP and Vision models in both academia and industry.**



Two types of work - Research DL models and use them. Hugging face is for the second one
